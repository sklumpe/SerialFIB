## SerialFIB ##

A Modular Platform for Streamlining Automated Cryo-FIB Workflows 

![Architecture Overview](DummyImages/SerialFIB.png)

SerialFIB is developed at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Research Group CryoEM Technology and the Mahamid group, European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL). 

It is written in Python3, comes with a PyQt5 GUI, and uses code from 3DCT [http://3dct.semper.space](http://3dct.semper.space)
So far, it has only been developed with Thermo Fisher Scientific AutoScript4. While we did our best to seperate SerialFIB's image handling from AutoScript4, other drivers have not been written yet, so its usage is limited to Thermo Fisher Scientific Instruments. It has been tested on 
the Aquilos and Scios system. AutoScript4 is commercially available from Thermo Fisher Scientific. 


While we did our best to provide a bug-free version, there will surely be things we missed. With questions, bug reports, and feature requests, please contact: 
klumpe (at) biochem.mpg.de

### Installation ###
Once AutoScript4 (version 4.0 and higher) has been installed on your system , the only package that is missing should be PyQt5.
It can be install simply via pip by typing

    pip install PyQt5

into the command line. 

Then, on the PC used to run SerialFIB (usually the Support PC on TFS DualBeam systems), simply clone the repository 

    git clone http://github.com/sklumpe/SerialFIB

and start the program by typing

    python SerialFIB.py

Alternatively, you can create a shortcut on the Desktop. Simply create one that points first to the python executable of your AutoScript4 
installation and then the path to the repository, pointing at the SerialFIB.py file. On our systems, this would e.g. look like this: 

	"C:\Program Files\Python35\envs\AutoScript\python.exe" D:\SharedData\SerialFIB\SerialFIB.py

Furthermore, in the same shortcut, please make sure to start the program in the directory of the GitHub repository, in this case:  

	D:\SharedData\SerialFIB

The SerialFIB GUI can also be run locally, either with a virtual AutoScript4 machine to enable response from the virtual microscope, 
or simply by starting SerialFIB (python SerialFIB.py). This will load dummy images found in the ./DummyImages/ directory of the repository.

For local installation without AutoScript4, the dependencies are: 

+ PyQt5
+ numpy
+ cv2
+ pickle
+ scikit-image


They can be installed by typing

    pip install PyQt5 numpy opencv-python PyWavelets scikit-image 

into the command-line of your OS.


### Installation on Zeiss Microscopes ###

In order to install SerialFIB on Zeiss microscopes, you need to install the Zeiss SmartSEM API on your CrossBeam. Then, a clean conda installation with the packages as described above for TFS instruments will get you everything you need for running SerialFIB. The installation will be made easier in the future, and these improvements are undergoing. Until then, you will need to change following parameters in the Zeiss CrossBeam Driver to the appropriate file locations: 

In src/Zeiss/CrossbeamDriver.py:

	self.dummy_pattern=r"D:/SerialFIB/TemplatePatterns/Zeiss/layout001.ely"

Pointing to the SerialFIB installation Directory.

And potentially (this should be at the same location for any SmartSEM installation but might differ if it is not a standard installation):
	self.probe_table=r"C:/ProgramData/Carl Zeiss/SmartSEM/Config/ProbeTable.xml"

pointing towards the ProbeTable of the microscope. 

Additionally, make sure that the standard API directory "C:/api/" exists, and if not, create it. 

Same goes for the standard API Drop directory:
	C:/ProgramData/Carl Zeiss/SmartFIB/API/Drop/

Zeiss is working on the API installer to make sure that these are created automatically, but this is currently not the case. 

In the crossbeam_client.py file, you might need to adjust the path to the ProbeTable as described above:
	self.probe_table = r"C:/ProgramData/Carl Zeiss/SmartSEM/Config/ProbeTable.xml"

That should be all. As mentioned before, installation will be improved to be more plug-and-play. If you run into problems, just drop an E-Mail to "klumpe@biochem.mpg.de".

### Usage ###

A tutorial on how to use SerialFIB can be found in the repository. [https://github.com/sklumpe/SerialFIB/blob/main/20210428_SerialFIB_Tutorial.pdf](https://github.com/sklumpe/SerialFIB/blob/main/20210428_SerialFIB_Tutorial.pdf).

Tutorial videos with explanations on how SerialFIB works and its usage are uploaded to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR7ngJ0apBk&t=0s).

Scripting examples are given in the ./ScriptingExamples/ directory and include unit test we used during development. 




The analysis script for SEM images produced by SerialFIB's volume imaging module can be found in the directory ./analysis/ . Generaly usage is

    python processSEM.py -indir INPUT_DIRECTORY -outdir OUTPUT_DIRECTORY

where input_directory holds the images to be processed. 

All adjustable parameters can be viewed by the -h flag.
